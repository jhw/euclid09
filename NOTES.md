### tagging and purging

- by default patches are just saved with timestamp, but all are saved to sunvox
- you have to call a tag() method for it to create a new commit, with a name
- prune() removed all non- tagged commits and maybe non- tagged sunvox files also
- only tagged versions are persisted by git
